--- ErrorReport:

InvalidOperationException: Begin cannot be called again until End has been successfully called.
   at Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics.SpriteBatch.Begin(SpriteSortMode sortMode, BlendState blendState, SamplerState samplerState, DepthStencilState depthStencilState, RasterizerState rasterizerState, Effect effect, Matrix transformMatrix)

--- OccurrenceProcess:

After selecting Chinese, the latest version of Thorium Mod will have an InvalidOperationException when querying the recipe for some items(e.g. Unholy shards).

--- ErrorCause:

Use "spaces" to split the string to get the value. But no "spaces" in Chinese...

--- ReproductionFrequency

Always

--- TemporarySolution:

Add "spaces" to UsesLife and UsesMana in Terraria.Localization.Content.zh-Hans.Items.

Original:
"UsesLife": "消耗{0}生命"
"UsesMana": "消耗{0}法力"

Changed:
"UsesLife": "消耗 {0} 生命"
"UsesMana": "消耗 {0} 法力"

--- Others

Thanks to @Rebuild for discovering the cause of the error and providing a solution.
